🔴 What is distinct in JavaScript?
Getting distinct values from an array of objects in JavaScript involves extracting unique values from a specific property across all objects. This process eliminates duplicates, providing a clean and concise representation of the unique values present within the array. eg: Product.distinct("category")

🔴 What is reduce() in JavaScript?
JavaScript Array Reduce(): Explained With Syntax and Examples ...
The array reduce in JavaScript is a predefined method used to reduce an array to a single value by passing a callback function on each element of the array. It accepts a function executed on all the items of the specified array in the left-to-right sequence. The returned single value is stored in the accumulator. eg: const grossIncome = allOrders.reduce((prev, order) => prev + (order.total || 0), 0);

something :
"start" : "node dist/server.js";
"build" : "tsc";
"watch" : "tsc -w";

watch command --> iska use ye hai ki mtlb baar baar tsc command nhi krna padega js me change krne ke liye , auto change hota rahega jaise jaise agar file me changes honge toh , sbse jyada useful best h 






 * Note: agar ek terminal bachana hai aur 2 terminal ki bajay ek se hi watch aur nodemon use krna hai to ye code 🤏
 "start": "concurrently \"tsc -w\" \"nodemon dist/server.js\"",
 isme, npm start dena hoge sirf command -->


 * agar do terminal me split krke chalana hai alag alag to ye code 🤏
 "scripts": {
    "start": "node dist/server.js",
    "build": "tsc",
    "watch": "tsc -w",
    "dev": "nodemon dist/server.js"

🔴# Production increate Percentage nikalne ke liye : assume is mahine 8 product create hua h and last month 2 product create hua tha toh uska total percentage kitna hoga - 

🔸Formula of relative change means difference of prev month and current month : ((thisMonth - lastMonth) /   lastMonth) * 100;  , so here eg: (8-2)/2*100 = 300% production increased compared to last month 

🔸Formula of absolute change means both included : (thisMonth / lastMonth) * 100; , so here eg: (8/2) * 100 = 400% production increased compared to last month , Note that I used Absolute Percent in my feature file to calculate percentage of last month and this month





# ./redux/store - redux/toolkit - // middleware: (mid) => [...mid(), userAPI.middleware], ye redux toolkit ke purane version me use ho skta tha but ab naye version me nhi ho skta strict rule ho gya h ab , isliye ab aesa likhna hota h  middleware: (getDefaultMiddleware) => getDefaultMiddleware().concat(userAPI.middleware),


🔴 RTK Query : mutation and query me difference in rtk query

In RTK Query, a mutation and a query are two types of APIs that you can define to interact with your backend.

A query in RTK Query is used to fetch data from the server. It's similar to a GET request in REST APIs. When you define a query, you specify the endpoint URL, the method (usually GET), and the parameters that will be sent with the request.

A mutation in RTK Query is used to send data to the server to create, update, or delete resources. It's similar to a POST, PUT, or DELETE request in REST APIs. When you define a mutation, you specify the endpoint URL, the method (usually POST, PUT, or DELETE), and the data that will be sent with the request.
